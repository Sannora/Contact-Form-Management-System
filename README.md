**Contact Form Management System ✉️📝**

A contact form managament system web app project that I've developed during my internship at OBSS Teknoloji

**Description**

This is a React web app that is basic contact form management system. The app has features of authentication and state management. The app has two user roles; reader and admin. Users submit basic contact forms including the name, message, country and gender information. They are listed in the messages page and each message can be displayed separately and marked as read when they are seen. App also has admin utilities of deleting and updating users and displaying the user list in the users page. Users have name, password and image attributes. There is also a reports page where the admin users can see the visual distrubution of users according to their country and gender visualised as charts. App also has not found and not authorized pages.

For UI development I've used Material UI for the first time both to achieve a simple, modern look following the material approach and to learn and practice a common UI library. For the data visualisation I've used Recharts library.
